# Bash-Scripting



What are Shell and Bash? Why do we need Shell Scripting?


Shell :-

A Shell is a program that lets you interact with the operating system by typing commands. It's like a bridge between you and the computer's core (kernel).


Bash :-
Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is the most commonly used Shell. It supports powerful scripting features like variables, loops, and conditionals.
