What are Conditional Statements in Bash?

Conditional statements in Bash allow a script to make decisions based on whether a certain condition is true or false.

They help you control the flow of your script â€” i.e., what code to execute depending on various logical conditions.


Types of Conditional Statements in Bash

Statement	    Description
if	            Basic condition check
if-else     	Executes one block if condition is true, another if false
if-elif-else	Multiple conditions (like a ladder)
case	        Used for matching patterns (like a switch in other languages)
