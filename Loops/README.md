What Is a Loop in Bash?

A loop is a fundamental concept in programming used to repeat a set of instructions until a certain condition is met or for a fixed number of times.

In Bash scripting, loops help automate repetitive tasks like:

1: Processing multiple files

2: Repeating a command

3: Iterating through arrays or lists

Why Use Loops in Bash?

Because in shell scripting, you often deal with:

1: Multiple files

2: Repetitive checks

3: Monitoring logs

4:Automating tasks

Instead of writing the same code 10 times, you write it once in a loop â€” and it runs as many times as needed.

=> Types of Loops in Bash: 

| Loop Type | Purpose                             | Syntax Example                     |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `for`     | Loop over a list or array           | `for item in list; do ... done`    |
| `while`   | Loop while a condition is true      | `while [ condition ]; do ... done` |
| `until`   | Loop until a condition becomes true | `until [ condition ]; do ... done` |
| `select`  | Create simple menus (less common)   | `select item in list; do ... done` |
